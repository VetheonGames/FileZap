# Project Development Schedule

Greetings — I'm Vetheon, the creator and primary architect of this project.

While this endeavor is close to my heart, so too is my growing family — and, of course, my full-time professional commitments. As such, my availability during the workweek is extremely limited.

Development updates will primarily occur on weekends, with the exception of every third weekend, during which there will be a scheduled pause in contributions.
